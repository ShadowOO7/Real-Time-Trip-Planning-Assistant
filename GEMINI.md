## Changes

### 2025-08-28

- Initialized `GEMINI.md` file to log project changes.
- Made the frontend layout responsive by:
  - Modifying `client/src/pages/Home.jsx` to use a flexible and responsive layout for different screen sizes.
  - Removing the fixed height from `client/src/components/Slideshow.jsx` to allow it to adapt to its container.
- Centered the main application content by:
  - Updating `client/src/styles/app.css` to make the `.app-container` a flex container that centers its children.
  - Removing a redundant padding class from `client/src/App.jsx`.
- Fixed Navbar alignment:
  - Moved the `Navbar` component outside the main content `div` in `client/src/App.jsx` to ensure it spans the full width of the viewport.
- Modified "Add New Trip" functionality:
  - Updated `client/src/components/Planner/AddTripModal.jsx` to allow adding multiple items (destinations/activities) to a trip.
  - Updated `client/src/pages/Planner.jsx` to handle the new `items` array in the trip object and display these items in the trip list.
- Backend changes for "Finalize Trip" button:
  - Modified `server/src/models/Trip.js` to replace the `destination` field with an `items` array (array of strings).
  - Confirmed that `server/src/controllers/tripController.js`'s `createTrip` function automatically handles the `items` array due to the updated model.
